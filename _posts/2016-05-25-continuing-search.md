title: Making baby steps
---

I decided I need to start somewhere. I was thinking about actually
going to College and getting a degree. It always bothered me that
both of my parents have College degrees and I don't. Is it
supposed to be other way around? Well, my husband convinced me that
if I really want to learn to code not just learn theoretical
Computer Science it would be better if I took some coding
courses/classes. We decided if that not going to work I could always
go back to College but first I should try and do something simpler
without the 4 years commitment.

We did our research, we looked into a lot
of coding bootcamps, some where really pricey with promises of
employment. So we decided to take baby steps and I signed up for a
free online classes with Udacity and get a feeling on how it goes.
Courses they have seem very interesting and challenging and I decided
to start with Python. From the beginning I knew I have a few
obstacles, and my main obstacle is time. Even though my daughter is
in school, I still have errands and responsibilities. Unfortunately,
I don't have any help from family or anyone. As I mentioned before,
my husband works really hard to support us and all my other extended
family members are either unwilling, too old, dead or too crazy to help
me so pretty much it's all me. After I pick up my daughter I take her
to swimming, gymnastic or some other after school activity so basically
my "coding day is over" once I pick her up from school. Also,
I haven't learned programming in a while, even though I am not a beginner,
when you don't do something in a long time you tend to forget it.
All the interesting Udacity classes required knowledge of loops,
functions and if statements. So on my first day of classes I decided
just to go over those basic concepts and refresh my memory. For loops, while
loops, if statements, elseif and all that fun :) 

So, yea, it's all baby steps hopefully will get me somewhere
interesting and eventually I will be able to accomplish my goal.
